						<h3>About the System Developer</h3>
						<p>This system was developed by Bachelor of Science in Information Technology students from Laguna State Polytechnic University Sta. Cruz Campus. This was planned and developed inÂ partial fulfillment of Capstone Project and also to provide more opportunities to differently-abled persons.</p>
						<p>3S, the initial S stands for Search, implying that system users would be able to search for employment depending on their disability category and location. The second S stands for support, which signifies that firms may now simply share or post job openings and recruit talented employees.The last S stands for share, which indicates that contributors can now support PWD organizations' projects and differently-abled people's personal endeavors by donating to the project posted. </p>
